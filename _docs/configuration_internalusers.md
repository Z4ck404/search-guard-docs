# Configuring internal users and roles

Search Guard ships with an internal user database. You can use this user database if you do not have any external authentication system like LDAP or Active Directory in place. Users, their hashed passwords and roles are stored in the internal Search Guard configuration index on your cluster.

Internal users are configured in `sg_internal_users.yml`. You can find a template in `<ES installation directory>/plugins/search-guard-5/sgconfig/sg_internal_users.yml`

Syntax:

```yaml
<username>:
  hash: <hashed password>
  roles:
    - <rolename>
    - <rolename>
```

Example:

```yaml
admin:
  hash: $2a$12$xZOcnwYPYQ3zIadnlQIJ0eNhX1ngwMkTN.oMwkKxoGvDVPn4/6XtO
  roles:
    - readall
    - writeall

analyst:
  hash: $2a$12$ae4ycwzwvLtZxwZ82RmiEunBbIPiAmGZduBAjKN0TXdwQFtCwARz2
  roles:
    - readall

```

**Note that the username cannot contain dots. If you need usernames with dots, use the `username` attribute:**

```yaml
<username>:
  username: username.with.dots
  hash: ...
```

## Generating hashed passwords

The password hash is a salted BCrypt hash of the cleartext password. You can use the `hash.sh` script that is shipped with Search Guard to generate them:

``plugins/search-guard-5/tools/hasher.sh -p mycleartextpassword``

## Configuration

In order to use the internal user database, set the `authentication_backend` to `internal`. For example, if you want to use HTTP Basic Authentication and the internal user database, the configuration looks like:

```yaml
basic_internal_auth_domain:
  enabled: true
  order: 1
  http_authenticator:
    type: basic
    challenge: true
  authentication_backend:
    type: internal
```

## Pre-defined users

Search Guard ships with the following pre-defined users:

| Username | Password | Description |
|---|---|---|
| admin | admin | Full access to the cluster and all indices, but no access to the Search Guard configuration. Use an admin certificate for that. |
| kibanaserver | kibanaserver | Internal Kibana server user, for configuring `elasticsearch.username` and `elasticsearch.password` in `kibana.yml`. Has all permissions on the `.kibana` index. |
| kibanaro | kibanaro | Regular Kibana user, has `READ` access to all indices and   all permissions on the `.kibana` index. |
| logstash | logstash | Logstash and Beats user, has `CRUD` and `CREATE_INDEX`  permissions on all logstash and beats indices |
| readall | readall | Has read access to all indices |

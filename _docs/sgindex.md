# Managing the Search Guard index

## Index name

If nothing else is specified, Search Guard uses `searchguard` as the name of the index where all configuration settings are stored.

You can configure the name of the Search Guard index. This is only necessary in special cases. If you have configured a Search Guard index name other than `searchguard`, you must configure this name via the `-i` switch.

## Replica shards

If the Search Guard index is created for the first time, the number of replica shards is determined automatically and is set to the number of nodes - 1. This means that a primary or replica shard of the Search Guard index is available on all nodes.

If you add or remove nodes, you can use the `-us` switch to set the number of replica shards manually. Usually, you want to set this to the number of data nodes - 1. This switch does not change any configuration settings.

If you want Search Guard to manage the number of replica shards automatically, you can enable and disable the replica auto-expand feature by using the `-era` and `-dra` switches. If this is enabled, Search Guard will monitor the cluster topology, and set the number of replica shards automatically whenever a node joins or leaves the cluster.

You read more about Search Guard and replica shards [in this blog post](https://floragunn.com/search-guard-index-replica-shards/).

Note that the `-us`, `-era` and `-dra` only apply if there is an existing Search Guard index.

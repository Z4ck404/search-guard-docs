# REST management API

This module adds the capability of managing users, roles, roles mapping and action groups via a REST Api.

## Installation

Download the REST management API enterprise module:

[REST API module](https://releases.floragunn.com/dlic-search-guard-rest-api/5.3-7/dlic-search-guard-rest-api-5.3-7-jar-with-dependencies.jar){:target="_blank"} 

`<ES installation directory>/plugins/search-guard-5`

After that, restart all nodes to activate the module.

## Prerequisites

The Search Guard index can only be accessed with an admin certificate. This is the same certificate that you use when executing [sgadmin](sgadmin.md).

In order for Search Guard to pick up this certificate on the REST layer, you need to set the `clientauth_mode` in `elasticsearch.yml` to either `OPTIONAL` or `REQUIRE`:

```yaml
searchguard.ssl.http.clientauth_mode: OPTIONAL
```

If you plan to use the REST API via a browser, you will need to install the admin certificate in your browser. This varies from browser to browser, so please refer to the documentation of your browser-of-choice to learn how to do that. 

For curl, you need to specify the admin certificate with it's complete certificate chain, and also the key:

```bash
curl --insecure --cert chain.pem --key kirk.key.pem "<API Endpoint>"
```

If you use the example PKI scripts provided by Search Guard SSL, the `kirk.key.pem` is already generated for you. You can generate the chain file by `cat`ing the certificate and the ca chain file:

```bash
cd search-guard-sll
cat example-pki-scripts/kirk.crt.pem example-pki-scripts/ca/chain-ca.pem > chain.pem
```

## General usage and return values

The API provides `GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE` handlers for users, roles, roles mapping and action groups. The general format is:

```
/_searchguard/api/<configuration type>/{resource name}
```

The `configuration type` can be one of:

* internalusers
* rolesmapping
* roles
* actiongroups

The resource name specifies the entry in the `configuration type` you want to operat on. In case of the internal user database, it specifies a user. In case of roles, it specifies the role name, and so on.

The API returns the following HTTP status codes:

* 200: A resource was modified succesfully
* 201: A resource was created
* 400: The request could not be processed
* 404: The resource could not be found

The response body has the format:

```json
{
  "status":<HTTP status code>,
  "message":<message>
  "invalid_keys":
  "missing_mandatory_keys"
  "specify_one_of:"
}
```

The last three entries are returned if you `PUT` a new resource but the content is malformed. `invalid_keys` is used when the content contains invalid keys. `missing_mandatory_keys` is used when a mandatory key is missing. And`specify_one_of` is used when the content is missing a key.


## Get Configuration API

### Endpoint

```
/_searchguard/api/configuration/{configname}
```
Where `configname` can be one of

* config
* internalusers
* rolesmapping
* roles
* actiongroups

### GET

```
GET /_searchguard/api/configuration/{configname}
```
A successful call returns a JSON structure containing the complete settings for the requested configuration, for example: 

```json
  "sg_role_starfleet" : {
    "backendroles" : [ "starfleet", "captains", "cn=ldaprole,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" ],
    "hosts" : [ "*.starfleetintranet.com" ],
    "users" : [ "worf" ]
  }
```

## User API

Used to receive, create, update and delete users. Users are added to the internal user database. It only makes sense to use this if you use `internal` as the `authentication_backend`.

### Endpoint

```
/_searchguard/api/user/{username}
```
Where `username` is the name of the user.

### GET
```
GET /_searchguard/api/user/{username}
```
Returns the settings for the respective user in JSON format, for example:

```
GET /_searchguard/api/user/kirk
```

```json
{
  "kirk" : {
    "hash" : "$2a$12$xZOcnwYPYQ3zIadnlQIJ0eNhX1ngwMkTN.oMwkKxoGvDVPn4/6XtO",
    "roles" : [ "captains", "starfleet" ]
  }
}
```
### Delete

```
DELETE /_searchguard/api/user/{username}
```

Deletes the user specified by `username`. If successful, the call returns with status code 200 and a JSON success message.

```
DELETE /_searchguard/api/user/kirk
```

```json
{
  "status":"OK",
  "message":"user kirk deleted."
}
```

### PUT

```
PUT /_searchguard/api/user/{username}
```

Replaces or creates the user specified by `username`.

```json
PUT /_searchguard/api/user/kirk
{
  "hash": "$2a$12$xZOcnwYPYQ3zIadnlQIJ0eNhX1ngwMkTN.oMwkKxoGvDVPn4/6XtO",
  "password": "kirk",
  "roles": ["captains", "starfleet"]
}
```
You need to specify either `hash` or `password`. `hash` is the hashed user password. You can either use an already hashed password ("hash” field) or provide it in clear text ("password”). (We never store clear text passwords.) In the latter case it is hashed automatically before storing it. If both are specified,`hash` takes precedence.

`roles` contains an array of the user's backend roles. This is optional. If the call is succesful, a JSON structure is returned, indicating whether the user was created or updated.

```json
{
  "status":"CREATED",
  "message":"User kirk created"
}
```

## Roles mapping API

Used to receive, create, update and delete the mapping of users, backendroles and hosts to Search Guard roles.

### Endpoint

```
/_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/{rolename}
```
Where `rolename` is the name of the role.

### GET

```
GET /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/{rolename}
```

Retrieve a role mapping, specified by rolename, in JSON format.

```
GET /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/sg_role_starfleet
```

```json
{
  "sg_role_starfleet" : {
    "backendroles" : [ "starfleet", "captains", "defectors", "cn=ldaprole,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" ],
    "hosts" : [ "*.starfleetintranet.com" ],
    "users" : [ "worf" ]
  }
}
```

### DELETE
```
DELETE /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/{rolename}
```

Deletes the rolemapping specified by `rolename`. If successful, the call returns with status code 200 and a JSON success message.

```
DELETE /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/sg_role_starfleet
```

```json
{
  "status":"OK",
  "message":"rolesmapping sg_role_starfleet deleted."
}
```

### PUT
```
PUT /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/{rolename}
```
Replaces or creates the role mapping specified by `rolename `.

```json
PUT /_searchguard/api/rolesmapping/sg_role_starfleet
{
  "backendroles" : [ "starfleet", "captains", "defectors", "cn=ldaprole,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com" ],
  "hosts" : [ "*.starfleetintranet.com" ],
  "users" : [ "worf" ]
}
```

You need to specify at least one of `backendroles`, `hosts` or `users`.

If the call is succesful, a JSON structure is returned, indicating whether the roles mapping was created or updated.

```json
{
  "status":"OK",
  "message":"rolesmapping sg_role_starfleet created."
}
```

## Roles API

Used to receive, create, update and delete roles and their respective permissions.

  "sg_role_starfleet" : {
    "indices" : {
      "pub*" : {
        "*" : [ "READ" ]
        "_dls_": "{ \"bool\": { \"must_not\": { \"match\": { \"Designation\": \"CEO\"  }}}}",
        "_fls_": [
          "Designation",
          "FirstName",
          "LastName",
          "Salary"
        ]
      }
    }

      "*" : [ "READ" ],
      _dls_: "{ \"bool\": { \"must_not\": { \"match\": { \"Designation\": \"CEO\"}}}}"
      _fls_: ["field1", "field2"]
    }
  }  
}
```

The JSON format resembles the format used in `sg_roles.yml`:

```json
{
  "cluster" : [ "<cluster permission>", "<cluster permission>", ... ],
  "indices" : {
    "<indexname>" : {
      "<typename>" : [ "<index/type permission>", "<index/type permission>", ... ],

    },
    "<indexname>" : {
      "<typename>" : [ "<index/type permission>", "<index/type permission>", ... ],
    }
  }
}
```

**If you're using DLS in the role definition, make sure to escape the quotes correctly!**

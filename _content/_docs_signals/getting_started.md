# Getting started with Signals Alerting for Elasticsearch
{: .no_toc}

{% include toc.md %}

Signals Alerting for Elasticsearch is distributed as part of Search Guard. To use Signals, you just need to install the Search Guard plugin for Elasticsearch and Kibana.

*Signals is right now in Beta state. At the moment, it is only available for Elasticsearch 7.3.2, 7.4.0, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 and 7.5.0.*

The technical preview includes both Signals and Search Guard, and can be installed the same way you would install Search Guard and the Search Guard Kibana plugin.
